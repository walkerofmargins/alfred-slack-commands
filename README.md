# alfred-slack-commands
Alfred command to automate slack

Simple command using Applescript

Created because I often find that I forget to put Slack to sleep when I'm on a call, and this little script means that I don't need to go back into Slack and turn it off

## dnd
Type 'dnd' into alfred, followed by the number of minutes you would like to snooze the app on your computer

## dndoff
Type 'dndoff' to resume notifications on Slack
